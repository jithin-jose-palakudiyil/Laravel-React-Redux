## About Project
#This site is made using Laravel for api development, React as Frontend and react-redux as state management tool in Laravel Framework.

In this site I have made an api for adding post, getting post and deleting post using laravel api and controller. Then i use it in react to perform action from UI without refreshing of page. This is i made for study purpose of react in laravel with redux

This is made beautifully using react redux. This site looks like this and is made using Materialize css.
